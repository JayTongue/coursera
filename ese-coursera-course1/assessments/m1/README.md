This code uses Bubble Sort to sort the given array in reverse order.
It then indexes the ends of the array for min and max values.
Median is found by first determining if the number of items is divisible by 2
If not, the center array item is returned. 
If so, the two center items are averaged.
The mean is found by finding the sum of all items in the array and dividing by array length.
